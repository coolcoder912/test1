    <p style="color:beige;">Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.</p>
    <p style="color:aqua;">It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.</p>
    <p style="color:blueviolet;">The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.</p>
    <p style="color:coral;">Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. </p>
    <p style="color:green;">The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007</p>
    <p style="color:greenyellow;">Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes.</p>
    <p style="color:grey;">The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</p>
    <p style="color:hotpink;">Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine.</p>
    <p style="color:white;"> The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively.</p>
    <p style="color: black;">The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.</p>
